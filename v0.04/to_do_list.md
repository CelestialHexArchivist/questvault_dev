   - [ ] Write tests for new scraper functionality (e.g., retry logic, dynamic content handling).
   - [ ] Add unit tests for database export functionality.

2. **Integration Testing**
   - [ ] Test scraper and database interaction with large datasets.
   - [ ] Ensure database switching works without breaking the search functionality.

3. **GUI Testing**
   - [ ] Simulate user interactions for search and sort features.
   - [ ] Test database selection and scraping workflows.

4. **Stress Testing**
   - [ ] Measure performance when handling large numbers of items.
   - [ ] Verify the application handles simultaneous scraping sessions gracefully.
